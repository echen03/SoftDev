    <h1> What is Less?
        <p>
          Less or Leaner Style Sheets is a "backwards-compatible language extension for CSS." <br>
          Essentially, it is like a combination of python and CSS: Less uses variables, functions, operations, nesting, and mixins, etc.<br>
          All these features will be demonstrated here.
